"for" in python:
Doesn't take the first "for" value, it's just like an add ig. It takes the "in" 
instead for the thing you want to use (for requires ITERATORS [whatever data kind of, lol]: "in my_list", 
but you do need to use the same "for" value again
Example:
" my_list = [A, O, E]
for z in my_list:
  print(z)  "
------------
will print you all the data/value inside, in this case, "A", "O", and "E".)

Classes:
Just the way to CLASSIFY (yep) the data, such as LISTS, STRINGS, INTEGERS, TUPLES
and whatever other data you can customize.
You can as well make your own class through "class myclass:"
and then indenting through tabs or some shit

Self:
Basically variables that are part of an instance (Will explain later), called by "(self)" and "self."

Instances:
An object that belongs to a class

Try and Except:
Just as it says again, try code and add exceptions for errors
(There can be multiple errors and just printing the descriptions of them)

Functions:
Creating new functions, with customizable use and values (Created through
"def mogus(arguments):
  print("amogus") ".
  
The "mogus" is just a random name I gave to it, the "(arguments)" are just the values you could give to it
(not needed but it's pretty useful) and then the "print("amogus")" part is as well just the way you get it to work
in the way you want [You could as well just add to it any other values, such as change data, as an example bc there
are many more than I could explain right now]

Position:
If used "/" on a function, it'll be only usable with positional arguments
(Values typed on the order they are while defining the function).
And continuing, (because this "tutorial" made by a noob is really short), if used "*" on a function
(Both done with a comma, separated from the main value, being the "/" used like this "function(a, /" and ' * ' done like this
"function(*, a)"], it'll only be usable through keywords (basically stricted to only naming the value you want to
change or something)
