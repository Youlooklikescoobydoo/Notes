"for" in python:
Doesn't take the first "for" value, it's just like an add ig. It takes the "in" 
instead for the thing you want to use (for requires ITERATORS [whatever data kind of, lol]: "in my_list", 
but you do need to use the same "for" value again
Example:
" my_list = [A, O, E]
for z in my_list:
  print(z)
------------
will print you all the data/value inside, in this case, "A", "O", and "E".)

Classes:
Just the way to CLASSIFY (yep) the data, such as LISTS, STRINGS, INTEGERS, TUPLES
and whatever other data you can customize.

Self:
Basically variables that are part of an instance (Will explain later), called by "(self)" and "self."

Instances:
An object that belongs to a class

Try and Except:
Just as it says again, try code and add exceptions for errors
(There can be multiple errors and just printing the descriptions of them)
