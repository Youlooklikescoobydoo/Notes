Strings:
To store an string you gotta type down "char mystring[] = string" [or just straight up "char mystring = string" for
a single character i think] ("mystring" and "string" are placeholders for whatever you want to type down), you also need 
to format text if you want to put new data inside an string (string which needs "printf()") 
and type a comma after the string (current format knowing: %s means string formatting)

Text formatting:
To add the strings or numbers that you want to add, add "%s" (For strings) then do a comma and type the name of the
variable. For numbers it's "%d"
(Example:
  int main() {
    char skeleton[] = "Skeleton appears";
    printf("The %s", skeleton);
    return 0;
  }
  
Here you got a simple C script, which it's output will be "The Skeleton appears", pretty surely)
For floats (0.2, as example) you have to do "%f"

For making functions, you have to add an "()" for the parameters and use these "{}" for the code of the function
like:
"int mogus(int bruh) {
  bruh = 1;
  return bruh + 1;
}"
and I think that will work for adding 1 + 1 through a function because I haven't got a better example lol

For opening a file you gotta use the "FILE" element, use a pointer "FILE *pogfil", and then in another line
type "pogfil = fopen(filename, mode)". Same goes for closing but without the attributes for "fopen"
