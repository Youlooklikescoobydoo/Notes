Strings:
To store an string you gotta type down "char mystring[] = string" ("mystring" and "string" are placeholders
for whatever you want to type down), you also need to format text if you want to put new data inside an string
(string which needs "printf()") and type a comma after the string (current format knowing: %s means string formatting)
